# Introduction-to-Artifical-Intelligence

This repository contains the solutions for the Assignments 2, 3, and 4 of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course from NTNU (2021/2022).<p>
Assignments 1 and 5 are theoretical and are not present in this repository.


## [Assignment 2](./Assignment2)
This exercise is about implementing the A* algorithm to find shortest paths in 2D grids.

## [Assignment 3](./Assignment3)
In this Assignment the Minimax algorithm for adversarial search is implemented. Also, the Minimax implementation is extended by
using alpha-beta pruning, in order to speed up the search. The “Pac-Man projects” developed at UC Berkeley were used in this Assignment.

## [Assignment 4](./Assignment4)
In this Assignment a general solver for Constraint Satisfaction Problems is implemented, specifically using backtracking search and the arc-consistency algorithm AC-3.
The program is then used to solve Sudoku boards of varying difficulty.
